    <h1>Terms & Privacy</h1>
    <p>The terms and privacy of adopt a pet are as follows:</p>
    <p>Terms of Service:</p>
    <!-- Chat GPT because I didn't feel like creating them myself -->
    <p>Adoption Eligibility: By using our pet adoption services, you agree that you are eligible to adopt a pet according to the laws and regulations of your jurisdiction. You must be of legal age and capable of assuming responsibility for the care and well-being of the adopted pet.</p>

    <p>Pet Care Responsibilities: Upon adoption, you agree to provide the adopted pet with proper care, including but not limited to food, shelter, veterinary care, and love. You also agree to comply with all local laws and regulations regarding pet ownership, including licensing and vaccination requirements.</p>

    <p>Adoption Process: Our adoption process may include an application, interview, and home visit to ensure the compatibility of the pet with your lifestyle and living situation. We reserve the right to decline adoption if we believe it is not in the best interest of the pet.</p>

    <p>Adoption Fees: Adoption fees may apply and are used to cover the costs associated with pet care, including vaccinations, spaying/neutering, microchipping, and medical treatments. Fees are non-refundable and are subject to change without notice.</p>

    <p>Pet Return Policy: In the event that you are unable to care for the adopted pet, you agree to return the pet to us rather than surrendering it to a shelter or abandoning it. We will make every effort to rehome the pet in a suitable environment.</p>

    <p>Privacy Policy:</p>

    <p>Information Collection: We collect personal information, such as your name, address, email address, and phone number, when you inquire about or apply to adopt a pet. We may also collect information about your preferences and lifestyle to help match you with the right pet.</p>

    <p>Information Use: We use the information you provide to process adoption applications, communicate with you about available pets and adoption events, and provide support and follow-up after adoption. We may also use your information to improve our services and outreach efforts.</p>

    <p>Information Sharing: We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. However, we may share your information with trusted partners, such as veterinary clinics or rescue organizations, to facilitate the adoption process or provide necessary services.</p>

    <p>Data Security: We take reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <p>Policy Changes: We reserve the right to update or modify this privacy policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on our website with a revised effective date. Continued use of our services after the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.</p>

    <p>Please note that these are sample statements and may need to be customized to fit the specific practices and policies of your pet adoption organization. Additionally, it's recommended to seek legal advice when drafting official terms of service and privacy policy documents.</p>
